Several experiments have witnessed increasing violation of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation, connecting the translational self-diffusion and viscosity, in supercooled water and its mixture with different cosolvents, like glycerol, as the temperature decreases. Earlier studies explained the breakdown of the SE relation in terms of the location of the Widom line, emanating from the liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP). Although these studies made a significant contribution to understand the above phenomena, a detailed molecular picture is still lacking.
Recently our group has been able to explain the SE breakdown from jump-diffusion approach [1-3]. The jump-diffusion coefficient — emanating from jump translation of water molecules — is calculated quantitatively for different temperature and pressure conditions. It is observed that the jump-diffusion is the key factor for the SE breakdown in supercooled water. The same method is adopted in the present work to explain the similar behavior in water/glycerol binary mixture at different temperatures.
