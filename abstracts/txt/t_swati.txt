HIV-1 is restricted in macrophages and certain quiescent myeloid cells due to a “Scorched Earth” dNTP starvation strategy attributed to the Sterile Alpha Motif and HD domain protein – SAMHD1. Active SAMHD1 tetramers are assembled by GTP-Mg+2-dNTP cross bridges and cleave the triphosphate groups of dNTPs at a Km of ~ 10 uM, which is consistent with dNTP concentrations in cycling cells, but far higher than the equivalent concentration in quiescent cells. HIV-2 and SIV have evolved defences against SAMHD1, underscoring its role in restriction. The regulation of SAMHD1 by phosphorylation (at T592) and Glutathione driven redox reactions  has been experimentally studied and yet not properly understood. We have used correlation network analysis along with molecular dynamics techniques to study the flow of allosteric information across the active complex. I will discuss how our MD analysis has yielded insights that complement and expand X-Ray and biochemistry based models of SAMHD1 activity.
