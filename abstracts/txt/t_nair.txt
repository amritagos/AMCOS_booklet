Molecular dynamics (MD) methods are widely used to study molecular level mechanism and free energetics of chemical reactions and structural transformations in soft matter systems. Biased MD simulations are employed to accelerate transitions between two metastable states on a high dimensional free energy landscape. However, the computational efficiency of biased sampling methods decreases with increasing dimensionality, which in turn severely limits the predictive power of enhanced sampling approaches. Moreover, it is preferred that the biasing energy is not leaked out to irrelevant modes. Here we propose a new method called the “Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling”(TASS) to overcome these limitations. This approach allows us to perform controlled exploration of a complex free energy landscape even when it is broad and unbound, like in the case of A+B type reactions, drug binding etc. TASS enables us to choose large number of orthogonal collective coordinates for enhanced-sampling. Most importantly, we can change the dimensionality and description of orthogonal coordinates for different umbrella windows. After demonstrating the accuracy of our method, I will discuss various applications including modelling enzymatic reactions.
