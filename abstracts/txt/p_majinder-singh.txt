The demand of pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) has grown very rapidly in food packaging, 
stationary and healthcare industries owing to its characteristic adhesion property. Several petro- 
based tackifying monomers such as 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2-EHA), iso-octyl acrylate and n-butyl 
acrylate provide sufficient substrate adhesion but these are neither sustainable nor renewable. The 
bio-sourced acrylated epoxidized linseed oil (AELO) and acrylated epoxidized methyl ester 
(AEME) have the potential to act as tackifying monomer which are renewable, sustainable, cost 
effective and ecofriendly in nature. In this investigation, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations 
have been employed to estimate their surface energy and binding energy against aluminum 
substrate. Further, mechanical response (shear and bulk modulus) was investigated to understand 
their resistance ability against shear deformation. The fractional free volume was estimated by 
varying applied stress and temperature, and further used to investigate their viscoelastic behavior 
to understand the ease of processability and compatibility. Besides being renewable and 
sustainable, both AELO and AEME showed improved surface energy, substrate binding energy, 
shear and bulk modulus, in comparison to chemically sourced 2-EHA. Moreover, AEME showed 
better performance properties than AELO, and thereby, proposed as a potential green tackifying 
monomer for developing PSAs.
