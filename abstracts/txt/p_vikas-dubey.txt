Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have great potential over proton exchange
membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to cost-effective energy conversion. However, $OH^{-}$ ion
transport is a key obstacle. It is evident that $OH^{-1}$ ion can move through the hydrated AEM via
two ways: (i) Grotthuss mechanism either via water chain or via AEM membrane surface sites,
and (ii) Vehicular diffusion via Brownian motion. A recent study based on multistate empirical
valence bond (MS-EVB) by Chen et al. has proposed that the vehicular diffusion contributes
approximately $80 \%$ to the total diffusion of the hydroxide ion via the hydrated poly-vinyl
benzyltrimethylammonium (PVBTMA) polymer. The remaining $20 \%$ is contributed by the
Grotthuss mechanism. This striking importance on vehicular diffusion motivated us to focus on
the vehicular diffusion of the hydroxide ions. In addition, a couple of more recent studies have
demonstrated a much larger importance of Grotthuss diffusion over the vehicular diffusion of
hydroxide ion in a different AEM. Thus there is a need for more investigation to understand the
$OH^{-1}$ ion transport. In this work, we used empirical force-field based classical MD simulation to
understand the structure and vehicular diffusion of $OH^{-1}$ ion. However, this method is inadequate
to explain reactions or transformations where bond breaking and formation occurs. But the
vehicular diffusion is obtained here in a straightforward way. This gives us a better
understanding of the possible role of $OH^{-1}$ ion transport via vehicular diffusion; results will be
discussed in the poster in more detail.
