We will review recent advances on the simulation of small-molecule
fluids as well as polymers at solid interfaces. We will cover wetting of
surfaces by liquids as well as the evaporation of liquid droplets from
them. We will also look at the structure formation of polymers near
solid surfaces and the resulting interphase properties, such as
encountered in coatings and nanocomposites.
