    We will review recent advances on the simulation of small-molecule  fluids as well as polymers at solid interfaces. We will cover wetting of surfaces by liquids as well as the evaporation of liquid droplets from  them. We will also look at the structure formation of polymers near  solid surfaces and the resulting interphase properties, such as  encountered in coatings and nanocomposites.
